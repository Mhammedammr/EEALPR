Enhanced Egyptian Automobile License Plate Recognition,
This project develops a computer vision system that extracts characters from low-resolution images of Egyptian license plates. 
The system has three stages, including license plate detection, image enhancement using GAN-based super-resolution technique (ESRGAN), 
and character detection using deep learning models on a professional website. 
The objective is to create an efficient system with practical applications in traffic enforcement and parking management.
